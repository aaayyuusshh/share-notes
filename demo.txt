Setup------------
Empty databases
Set master IP in front and backend
Start replicas
-----------------

Start 3-4 clients to show load balancing

Synchronization Part
1. Create a document and show token being created
2. Edit document and show changes being replicated
3. Show editing and locking mechanism

Election
1. Connect higher port before lower port to show that leader chosen is lowest port
2. Master will request doc list from leader (lowest port) when client connects

Consistency
1. Two clients on different machines view the same live changes being made from another client

Replication
1. Show SQLite DB's and logging of data being replicated and being broadcasted on frontend
Can show document creation by one client shown on anothers

Fault Tolerance
1. Replica crashes without token

2. Client editing with token and replica crashes

3. Replica crashes with token

CRASH ALL USING HARD EXIT!!
